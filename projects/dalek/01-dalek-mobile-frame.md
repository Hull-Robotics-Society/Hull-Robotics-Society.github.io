excerpt: "How we gave the Dalek mobility by repurposing an electric wheelchair and a custom joystick controller."
---  

When we started the Dalek project back in August 2024, the first goal was to make the frame mobile. To do this, we repurposed an **electric wheelchair** as the base for mobility. However, there was a major hurdle: the wheelchair’s controller required a compatible joystick, which we didn’t have.

To overcome this, we constructed a **custom joystick controller** using a 4-axis joystick. The joystick's outputs were fed into an **Arduino**, which then interfaced with the wheelchair's controller through its **DB9 connector**. This allowed us to control the Dalek’s movement accurately while keeping it modular.

Stay tuned as we continue to upgrade the Dalek's electronics and functionality in the next update!
