Before the Freshers Fair, we decided to give the Dalek a much-needed facelift. The Dalek was looking a little run-down, so our team gave it a **fresh coat of paint**.  

### What We Did:  
- **Front, Back, and Mid-Section**: Painted **black** for a sleek and professional look.  
- **Dalek Balls**: Repainted **silver** to restore their iconic shine.

The fresh paint job made the Dalek the star of our stall at the **Freshers Fair**, attracting students, staff, and curious onlookers alike!
