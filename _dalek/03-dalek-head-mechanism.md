One of our most exciting goals was to make the Dalek’s head spin. Unfortunately, this turned out to be more complex than anticipated. Due to the **mass of the Dalek’s head**, the inertia caused our initial mechanism to fail under the load.

We’ve put this feature on hold for now, but we’re already brainstorming ways to redesign the mechanism with:  
- Stronger materials  
- Improved torque control

Even though this challenge set us back, it has been a valuable learning experience. On to the next phase: **restoring the Dalek’s look** for Freshers Fair!
