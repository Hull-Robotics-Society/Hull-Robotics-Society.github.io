excerpt: "Enhancing joystick control with a relay module for smooth movement and lighting control."

After constructing the custom joystick controller, we faced another challenge: the wheelchair's control system required some pins to be shorted to ground to enable movement. To address this, we added a **4x relay module** to enhance the joystick’s capabilities.

Here’s what we achieved:  
- **Forward Movement**: The first relay allowed the Dalek to move forward.  
- **Left and Right Turns**: Two more relays handled left and right turning movements.  
- **Lighting Control**: The fourth relay controlled the Dalek’s **top lights**, powered by a **12V supply**.

These improvements brought the Dalek closer to full functionality. Stay tuned as we experiment with making the **head spin** in the next update!
