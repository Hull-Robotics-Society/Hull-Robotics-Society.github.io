We’re currently working on our most ambitious upgrade yet: making the Dalek **mind-controlled**! Using the **Emotive Epox X** headset, we’re exploring how to read brainwave signals to control the Dalek's movements.

Here’s how it works:  
- Brainwave signals from the **Epox X headset** are processed and sent to an **open-source robotics controller**.  
- A **Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen display** acts as the central hub, allowing for both manual and brainwave-based control.

This cutting-edge addition will showcase the intersection of **neuroscience** and **robotics**—a futuristic upgrade for our Dalek project!  

Stay tuned for more updates as we finalize this feature.
