# Dalek Schematics

Welcome to the Dalek project schematics page! Here you can download all the files you need to understand and replicate the Dalek design.

## Downloadable Files

- **[Source Code](https://example.com/dalek/code.zip)**  
  The full codebase for controlling the Dalek. This includes firmware and software for various systems.

- **[Fritzing Files](https://example.com/dalek/fritzing.zip)**  
  The Fritzing files for the Dalek electrical wiring. Use these to create your own breadboard designs.

- **[CAD Files (STL/STEP)](https://example.com/dalek/cad.zip)**  
  The complete set of CAD files, including 3D models of the Dalek parts in STL and STEP formats.

## CAD Viewer

Explore the Dalek 3D CAD model below. Use the controls to rotate and zoom in on different parts of the Dalek.

</div>

<!-- Or you could use a 3D Viewer embedding tool like 3DViewer, which can embed the viewer directly -->
<!-- Example -->
<!-- <script src="https://www.3dviewer.net/"></script> -->
<!-- <3d-viewer src="https://example.com/dalek/cad/your_model.stl"></3d-viewer> -->

## How to Use

1. **Download the files**: Click on the links above to download the files for the project.
2. **Explore the 3D Model**: Use the CAD viewer above to inspect the 3D model of the Dalek. You can rotate, zoom, and pan to get a detailed view of each part.
